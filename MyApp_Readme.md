# Project Overview

This project consists of two components: `MainComponent` and `Welcome`. 

## MainComponent

The `MainComponent` renders a container with a heading, a welcome message using the `Welcome` component, and two buttons. The buttons allow users to browse test data and connect a domain. Additionally, there is a footer content section that informs users about tenant connections in the free tier.

## Welcome

The `Welcome` component is responsible for rendering an animated welcome message inside an outer circle. The animation includes the outer circle's stroke color transitioning from purple to white and back, along with variations in opacity. It creates the effect of a white light revolving around the circle.
